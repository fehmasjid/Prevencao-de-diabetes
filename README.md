#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/iGOUwjlDnmU
#### Description: this is my final cs50 project. I developed a web app that is able to predict whether the patient is likely to have diabetes or not based on the exams collected in hospitals or health centers, the application user can type his name and enter his exam data in the bar on the left, in the center we have a chart for the best visualization of the data. just below the data entered and the accuracy of the model.

with data engineering, I collected the data from the pima site and transformed it in order to work on it.

I used the pandas library for the data and the streamlit to create the app

the code structure contains the title, header, user name input, and user data input such as pregnancy, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, body mass index, diabetes family history, and age.

graphic for greater visibility of user data.
model accuracy, and forecast returning 0 for negative and 1 for positive.
